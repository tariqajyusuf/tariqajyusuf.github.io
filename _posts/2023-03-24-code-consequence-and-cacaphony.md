For a good couple of months I’ve been considering starting some form of blog. I
have a personal blog but I felt a desire to put something together that felt a
little more concise and focused than random musings. I’ve been working in the
tech sector for almost a decade and have been playing with technology in some
form for most of my life starting with the old Toshiba laptop I accidentally
bricked (sorry, dad). In that time, technology has played an even more dominant
role in our lives.

The truth is, technological luddism is not a tenable option for even the most
off-the-grid types. Existing in society at all necessitates the presence of a
digital record of who you are from [receiving medical

or [simply buying a

In the United States (and arguably the rest of the world), there is no single
approach that an individual can take to understand the vastness of their digital
footprint.

# For You, From You
The amount of data that exists about any individual can give strangers,
bystanders, and other beings of either natural or artificial intelligence an
in-depth picture of who you are in some ways better than you may know yourself.
Society as a whole still struggles with the idea of managing the perspective of
one’s self while the technology industry marches forward. It’s only recently
that we’ve begun having significant and serious conversations about how this
affects individuals on a mental, physical, and societal level.

In the past couple of years, I’ve been shifting my own career work into a bridge
between society, technology, and policy. Seeing first hand how technology can
affect the deepest parts of ourselves and our communities regardless of how
niche or intimate they might be, I became more focused on understanding and
pondering these changes.

# Of Code and Consequence
Code and Consequence is meant to be a more structured form of these types of
musings; looking critically at the way technology is being used (and abused),
it’s impact on society and the world, and thinking more critically about the
way we decide to engage with the unprecedented speed of changes affecting
humanity. I don’t want this, however, to be a pessimists’ retreat. Being
adjacent to security, reliability, and other forms of risk engineering for some
time, it’s easy to become paranoid and yearn to disconnect from everything. We
are long from the place of blaming user error for critical failings in
technological practice, the time has come to consider technology with safety,
ethics, and integrity from the start.

Even more important is the role of society (read as: the “user” in “user error”)
in driving these conversations. In order to build a technologically driven
society, the users and impacted peoples of that technology must also be
considered. Consequentially, there must be more that we consider when building,
regulating, and driving The Market™.

# What About You, Reader?
I’ve been privileged to meet so many like-minded people in this space. Creating
a place to structure some of the conversations I’ve had at conferences, zoom
calls, and random Twitter banter felt like a natural next step. What I hope to
get from people who read this newsletter are more opinions, discussions, and
ideas that I had not thought to consider. In effect, this is a sounding board of
sorts for ideas that can change how we think about technology at a fundamental
level be you a technologist or a policy wonk.

I hope you enjoy the occasional musings I may include and hope to hear from you
on future ones.
