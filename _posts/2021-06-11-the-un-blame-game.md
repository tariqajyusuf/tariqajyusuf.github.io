One of the work practices I thoroughly embraced from previous jobs is creating a
blameless culture with people I work with. I am fortunate to work with some of
the smartest and most passionate people in the tech industry. A healthy work
dynamic can be a force multiplier for teams and the impact they can make.
Conversely, a "blameful" or "blame-fearing" culture can reduce the work
potential for a team, amplify problems, and result in burn out.

# Blameless Postmortems

Having come from the SRE/DevOps/Production Engineering world, I would be remiss
to not start this off with postmortems. When something goes wrong, the best
practice is to [focus on the actions not the individual](
https://sre.google/sre-book/postmortem-culture/#best-practice-avoid-blame-and-keep-it-constructive).
Blaming an individual creates a chilling effect where team members are
incentivized to cover their own tracks, involvement, or issues for fear of being
blamed for a problem. A recent example of this is the [Salesforce outage](
https://www.theregister.com/2021/05/19/salesforce_root_cause/),
the employee who was trying a quick fix "had action taken" against him. The
other team members may be less willing to take an action or even follow a
playbook if they feel that there is a chance of blame.

# Blameless Escalations

[Escalations are a good thing](
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/when-used-appropriately-escalation-good-thing-really-neil-campbell/),
they enable you and your team to quickly surface when something is critically
broken. They can be used to indicate disagreements with other teams or an
incident that requires a larger response, but it can also surface internal team
issues. As someone working on a team that is still staffing up, I've been
holding close to the advice that I got from a former colleague: if you find
people on your team that you would describe as heroes, then there's something
wrong. Your team or working group should be able to:

* Not fall over when people take vacation.
* Not need to overwork.
* Be able to think ahead of the next day/week/month.

When any of these things are not true, the right move is to escalate when
something can't get done. It makes it clear to the people above you that
something needs to change and is a critical part of [managing your management](

# Blameless Working Groups

An observation that I've made recently is that a lot of cross-functional groups
within the tech industry are generally geared towards shipping products in one
form or another. I've been part of a lot of cross-functional working groups that
have fallen apart primarily because the common goal has been de-emphasized or
forgotten. If you find yourself in a situation where you are blaming a team
member or a colleague, try to shift your focus to understand what their
incentives are and how you can align yourselves and them to the right path.

For example, as a privacy subject matter expert and a part of a privacy review
process, I typically will communicate that my job is to make it so that your
product or feature can launch in the best way possible. If you suspect that
there in fact isn't an alignment or if there's a disagreement, then that might
be a good candidate for escalation as mentioned above.
