Dear Superintendent Jose,

My name is Tariq, I am a software engineer and I ask you to stand behind Ahmed
Mohammed and his family to defend his right to express his creativity and
inventiveness. As a mentor for [First Lego League](
http://www.firstlegoleague.org/) teams, it is difficult to get kids into that
initial dive to get them excited about STEM.

You have a case where a bright student was disciplined, frightened, and
humiliated by one of your teachers because of his expression of his work. Ahmed
said later that he will never bring an invention to school again which is a loss
for the school and a shutting down of any desire to make more inventions.

As Superintendent representing the teachers, schools, and the best interests of
the students therein, I request that you:

* Provide public verbal and physical support of the family in their case by
  demanding the charges be dropped against him.
* Discipline the teacher that called officers to the school and implement
  measures such as diversity bias trainings to prevent it from occurring again.
* Call on the Irving Police Department to investigate the statements of the
  officers and their behavior towards Ahmed.
* Continue to fund STEM programs such as robotics and maker spaces for kids to
  have creative outlets and to make teachers familiar with the work they can
  create.

I look forward to your reply and action to support Ahmed and the creativity of
all your students.

Sincerely, \
Tariq Yusuf \
