I often have fun with back of the napkin calculations, they occasionally help
you get a good idea of how big numbers can get and what they can look like when
reallocated.Â Today's question: **If ISIS had to pay for the amount of publicity
they've gotten on cable news networks, how much would they have to pay?**

Well normally, a 30 second slot during the noon news on your local station will
go anywhere from [$200-1,500 per 30 second slot](
http://smallbusiness.chron.com/much-television-advertising-really-cost-58718.html)
. An article recently highlighted that CNN was charging [$200,000 for a 30
second ad](
http://adage.com/article/media/cnn-charging-40-times-usual-price-commercials-republican-debate/300185/)
during the Republican National debate (40x their normal pricing).

Let's assume that all cable networks charge CNN's normal amount for cable
advertising for all their slots (a conservative estimate for a reason). That
comes out to **$5,000 per 30 second slot**. That comes out to **$10,000 per
minute** or **$600,000 per hour**.

Now given all the media attention behind ISIS, we can conservatively estimate
that roughly half of the news coverage involves them in some way. However, cable
news is riddled with (you guessed it) advertising so let's bump it down from 12
hours of 24-hour news coverage to 8 hours.

That means that every day, ISIS gets $4.8 million in free publicity from a
single day on a single network. So bumping that up to a news cycle (1.5 weeks)
we know that they roughly get $52.8 million per cycle.

But it's larger than that! We have lots of news networks in the US including
CNN, Fox News, CBS, ABC, NBC, MSNBC. That comes out to **$316.8 million** per
news cycle on all the major networks.

Now the fun part, what could you do with $316.8 million every 11 days?

* Assuming the [average cost of college](
  http://www.collegedata.com/cs/content/content_payarticle_tmpl.jhtml?articleId=10064)
  for the past academic year (approximately $24,061), you could give 13,000
  students a free ride scholarship every 11 days.
* Using the [average cost of healthcare](
  http://www.forbes.com/sites/danmunro/2013/05/22/annual-healthcare-costs-surpasses-22000/) 
  for a family of four, every 11 days you could give free healthcare to 14,000
  families for the year.
* Pay for the [salaries](
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salaries_of_members_of_the_United_States_Congress)
  of roughly 1,800 members of congress (that comes out to a few more than four
  years of congress).
* Give [Water Wells for Africa](http://waterwellsforafrica.org/whats-the-cost/)
  enough to build 45,000 wells every 11 days.

At this point it begs the question, do they deserve that kind of attention?
