# Do What's Right, Not What's Easy.
Over the past few years, technology has played an increasing role in our lives
from the way we connect with each other to how our civil institutions function.
The connections between society and technology are indivisible and it bears a
sense of cautious optimism to create a future of hope and not fear.

I work as a technology ethics practitioner focusing primarily on privacy
engineering. Specifically, I specialize on evaluating complex systems and
technologies and identifying individual and social risks in order to mitigate
harm and increase benefits. I also provide pro bono consulting and activism in
the technology space for nonprofits and social causes to help equip them with
the tools necessary to bring about a better world.

This website mainly serves as a record of my work, mark of my existence, and a
measure of personal accountability. You can connect with me by email, on [
